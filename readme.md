## Summary
This tool was written in AutoHotKey and is not too related to the Google Sheets processes except for pasting in new Salesforce reports.

This tool is used to paste a report from Salesforce to the Chrono for the the VS PVD Dept. Teams to be able to recieve new accounts and continue to work and meet their SLA deadlines in time. This tool is a bit like the heart of the Chrono.

## Requirements
* This tool requires AutoHotKey. If it is not available, the script is [here at AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/).
* This tool currently requires a .bat file that is at the AutoUpdater computer's location. The script will break without it.
* Once downloaded, open the .ahk files with one of the AutoHotKey .exe's contained in the AutoHotKey.zip file.

## Usage Instructions
The AutoUpdater's computer is currently located in the office next to Rocky West. If it's ever down, head there. It will be the middle computer.

* Double-click AU9.3.ahk to begin running the script.
* From here on out, the script should work by itself.
