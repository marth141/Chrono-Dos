# Master-Backlog
## Manifest
This tool is to be able to simplify the Chrono into one backlog.

"Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute." - Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman

This lies behind a lot of the thought behind this program. The hopes is that the code will be much more development friendly as we move forward. Unique solutions are required by any business, and it'll be good that we make sure to keep this code focused in being able to facilitate new unique solutions as they are needed.

## Summary
Currently, this program will take a backlog from a backlog updater and begin preping it for viewing and usage by team's through the design department. The teams need to be able to track work properly and this tool's intent is to do just that. Currently it's designed around the **Proposal Process**. More processes will be added as the tool develops.
